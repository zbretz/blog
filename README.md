#Request For Help

If you want to go fast - go alone. If you want to go far - go together.

I encouarge you to contribute to this project. In fact, I ask for your help.

Here are some features that are in need of work. Feel free to fork, code, and make a pull request. If there are any thoughts you'd like to share, let's talk about them!

 - Highlight username in user-menu depending on the feed you're viewing.

 - Design the Questions + Answer system. Build off of blog model? Create new model? What about answers - how are those implemented?
